#  Revisiting the mortality in Alberta, Canada

## Overview

This repo contains the code and data to produce a paper which is a reproduction of comparison the Poisson with negative binomial models from "Telling Stories with Data" (Alexander,2023)


## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `inputs/data` contains the data file to be used for analysis.
-   `inputs/llm` contains the chat history with Chat-GPT3.5.
-   `outputs/paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document - paper.qmd, the PDF of the reproduction paper - paper.pdf, and reference bibliography file - references.bib.
-   `scripts` contains the code used to preparing, cleaning and testing the data.

## LLM Usage

In the development of this paper, a Large Language Model, specifically Chat-GPT 3.5, was employed for providing a idea of the coding components and a first draft of narrative composition. The entire chat history can be found in `inputs/llm/usage.txt`.
